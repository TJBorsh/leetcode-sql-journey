# 🧠 LeetCode SQL Journey

Welcome! This repository documents my journey through LeetCode’s SQL problems—starting from the very first problem and continuing daily with a target of **7 problems per week**. Each solution includes clean SQL syntax, problem explanations, and reflections where applicable.
